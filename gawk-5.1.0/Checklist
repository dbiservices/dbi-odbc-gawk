All paper work signed and sent in
All files checked in
Version information is correct in

	doc/gawkinet.texi
	extension/configure.ac
doc/texinfo.tex is up to date

Run prepinfo on the manual.
Spell check the manual.
Update the wordlist for spell checking.
test/Makefile.am: order and prettify lists of tests
API Version numbers have been modified correctly in gawkapi.h.

Testing on
	make clean
	make distclean
	make maintainer-clean
	make release

	compile with tcc
	compile with pcc
	compile with clang

	compile 32 bit tests - clang and gcc

	configure --disable-lint
	configure --disable-nls

	building in a different directory from the source
	building doc in a different directory from the source

The simplest way of making sure that no PO file is forgotten, is to 
run the following command just before rolling a new release:

  rsync -Lrtvz translationproject.org::tp/latest/gawk/ po

Major releases:
- Rotate the ChangeLog and NEWS files.
- When doing so, update any necessary Makefile.am files to
  list the rotated ChangeLog file!

========== For Releasing ============

To upload:
	gnupload --to ftp.gnu.org:gawk gawk-Whatever.gz

For doc:
	Use the perl makeinfo to create the files.
	Use gendocs.sh and gendoc_template from gnulib.
